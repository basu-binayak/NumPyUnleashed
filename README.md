## 🔧 Installation
You can install NumPy using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy
```
Or with conda:
```bash
conda install numpy
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
Here’s a simple example to create a NumPy array and perform basic operations:
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Array:", arr)

# Basic operations
print("Sum:", np.sum(arr))
print("Mean:", np.mean(arr))
print("Standard Deviation:", np.std(arr))
```
